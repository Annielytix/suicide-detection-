Using LSTM and NLP to detect suicidal ideation in tweets. 

<Alisha please edit using your words> I built the first version of my models when I was 14 years old in response to the growing rate of suicide in teens. I have first hand knowledge of the impact suicide has on those around the person who is struggling. And believed that Machine Learning could be used to predict one's propensity / risk for suicide based on the sentiment scraped from their online postings.
